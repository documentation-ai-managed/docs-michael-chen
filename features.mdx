## Document Organization and Hierarchies

Create a clear structure for your documentation using nested pages and folders. You build hierarchies that reflect your project's architecture, making navigation intuitive.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Folders" icon="folder">
    Start by creating top-level folders for major sections like `API Reference` or `User Guides`.

````bash
# In the UI, click "New Folder"
# Name it "API Reference"
````
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Nested Pages" icon="file-text">
    Within folders, add pages and sub-pages for detailed topics.

````markdown
# API Reference (Top-level page)
/api
  /endpoints
    /users.mdx
    /auth.mdx
  /schemas
````
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reorder with Drag-and-Drop" icon="move">
    Drag pages to reorder or nest them dynamically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
Use hierarchies to mirror your project's codebase structure for easier maintenance.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Live Cursor and Comments" icon="cursor-text">

  <Tab title="Version History" icon="git-branch">
    Revert changes or compare versions easily.

## Search and Filtering Tools

Locate any document or section quickly with full-text search and advanced filters.

| Filter Type | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|

| Tags | Filters by custom labels | `feature`, `bugfix` |
| Date Range | Recent changes only | Last 7 days |
| Author | Content by specific user | `@john.doe` |

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
```javascript
// Client-side search example
const results = searchDocs('authentication', { tags: ['api'] });
console.log(results);
```
```python
# Server-side search
results = client.search('authentication', tags=['api'])
print(results)
```
</CodeGroup>
